    <h2>Fried chicken recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and
      set aside. Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a
      deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt,
      black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper until
      thoroughly mixed. Set aside. Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large
      enough for the chicken to be immersed in the buttermilk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl. Next to that,
      your bowl of buttermilk, and next to that, your dry mixture. Take your
      breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture, then dip them in the
      buttermilk until they are coated, and then place them in the flour
      mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the
      flour mixture into the wet chicken. Make sure that the chicken in very
      thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve the crust and crunch you are
      looking for. Gently place the breasts in your hot oil. Next, repeat the
      dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh, leg
      then wing. When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16
      pieces of chicken in the oil. Set a timer for 15 minutes. After 15
      minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast.
      If it reads 180 degrees F, all of your chicken is done. (Keep in mind that
      it will continue to cook after it has been removed from the fryer.) Remove
      the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes. Let cool for an
      additional 10 minutes before serving.
